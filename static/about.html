      <h1>about furao.link</h1>
      <p id="msg">furao.link is an open source, no bullcrap link shortener designed by <a href="https://www.blitzw.in">blitzw.in</a> (ey/em), and a fork of <a href="https://ngn.tf"NGN</a>'s kisalt, who is responsible for most of the other code.</p>
      <p id="msg">it is meant to be simple, lightweight, and take minimal space! just paste a link into the main page's form, press enter, and there you go!</p>
      <p id="msg">also available as a handy bookmarklet. drag this to your toolbar: <a href="javascript:void(location.href='https://furao.link/add?url='+location.href);">shorten url to furao.link!</a></p>
      <p id="msg">furao.link is designed and styled off of the obscure transformers animated character fur√£o, and the use of the character's image applies as fair use, since this project is not for profit!</p>
